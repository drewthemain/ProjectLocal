# Project Local

A website dedicated to telling short horror on a global scale. Find, click, and read. Created by Drew White.

## Outline

Core functionality is based around a globe story "picker", where the user can find points of interest by location and read that story. While currently just a hub for my writing, will evolve over time to be a platform for all to share location-based horror (with an emphasis on the 'real', urban legends, local myths, etc.)

## Guide

### Startup

All that's need to complete the project are the following steps:
```bash
cd app
npm start
```

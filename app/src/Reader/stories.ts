Florence, Thomas’s mother, lost her high school teaching job due to unfortunate budget cuts. George, Thomas’s father, received fewer and fewer customers every day at his local bait and tackle shop and his typical fishing spots were running dry.

The river washed the scene in a wave of noise. Thomas couldn’t imagine how entire groups of fish could navigate the waters. However, he could imagine The Ridge in all of its glory. His hook would sink under the water and moments later be swung back with an award-worthy catch on the line. Thomas figured they could even sell some of the fish to make some money.

Thomas leaned over the edge and felt sick at the height of the drop. The water below was a beautiful blue, surely built up by centuries of collected rain and natural filtering. Small rocks and pieces of debris bobbed in the water, falling and surfacing with the flow. Thomas wasn’t sure how anyone could ever get out of the watery pit if fallen in. The edges of the hole were far too steep to climb and the loose mud surely didn’t help matters. The boy took a few steps back from the edge just to be safe.

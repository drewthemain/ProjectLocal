Truthfully, it always had been, but the Robles were quite good at hiding it. Every year saw just enough money for a few presents under the tree when that dreaded time came. It was those months leading up to the happiest time of the year that proved to be the roughest for the family. Tala, Rodrigo’s mother, lost her teaching job due to unfortunate budget cuts. Iman, Rodrigo’s father, received fewer and fewer customers every day at his local bait and tackle shop and his typical fishing spots were running dry.

Rodrigo had to lightly jog to keep up with the stranger’s excitement. The pole he carried bounced to and fro with every step, occasionally getting caught on the breeze or a loose leaf. The river washed the scene in a wave of noise. Rodrigo couldn’t imagine how entire groups of fish could navigate the waters. However, he could imagine The Ridge in all of its glory. His hook would sink under the water and moments later be swung back with an award-worthy catch on the line. The boy figured they could even sell some of the fish to make some money. That would certainly make his mother happy.","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"6midj","text":"“How much further?” Iman asked.

His giddiness was bubbling over the pot.","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"d9sjl","text":"Rodrigo caught a glimpse of a figure ahead. The ground sloped upward to where the fisherman was standing. They lost the river in the mess of trees. Verne led them up the hill, stopping only to make sure the father and son were following.

Men sat on the edge of the hole with a pole in one hand and a beer in the other. A few trees hung over the basin like an umbrella. The men sent friendly nods to the approaching group. Rodrigo leaned over the edge and felt sick at the intense height of the drop. The water below was a beautiful blue, surely built up by centuries of collected rain and natural filtering. Small rocks and pieces of debris bobbed in the water, falling and surfacing with the flow. Rodrigo wasn’t sure how anyone could ever get out of the watery pit if fallen in. The edges of the hole were far too steep to climb and the loose mud surely didn’t help matters. The boy took a few steps back from the edge just to be safe.","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"erns4","text":"Iman admired the fellow fishermen.
